 A very fast class framework. Allows OOP concepts in javascript including classes, inheritance, multi-inheritance, polymophism, interfaces, and enumerators without using TypeScript. Provides scope isolation via dependency injection in modules, controllers, and factories. Also very small at only 3 kb for the minified version. (compare that to prototypejs minified 93.38 kb)
