 A very fast class framework. Allows OOP concepts in javascript including classes, inheritance, multi-inheritance, polymophism, interfaces, and enumerators without using TypeScript. Also very small at only 2.5 kb for the minified version. (compare that to prototypejs minified 93.38 kb)

.: Getting Started :.

To get started grab ds.oop.min.js (This is the minified oop library)
Then head on over to the wiki @ http://github.com/digital-synapse/ds.oop/wiki to view the guide and documentation or clone the project and run classtest.htm to view some more examples.

.: New Features :.

ds.oop now supports constructorless classes and static classes as well as namespaces! Enjoy!
